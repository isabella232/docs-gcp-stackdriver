This topic describes how to use GCP Stackdriver Nozzle for Pivotal Platform.

With the nozzle deployed, you can view logs and metrics from Pivotal Platform in [Stackdriver Logging](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer) and [Stackdriver Monitoring](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring). The logs and metrics available depend on the **Events to subscribe to** field that you set when [Configuring Stackdriver Nozzle for Pivotal Platform](./installing.html#opsman-config).
